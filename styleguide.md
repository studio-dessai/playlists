Lists are to be fashioned so:

**Playlist for year–month–day**

1. artist name - track title (_release_, label, year, country)
1. artist name - track title (_release_, label, year, country)
1. etc.

Please link the artist names to their corresponding [MusicBrainz](http://musicbrainz.org/) page (including features artists and remixers). If the page does not exist, it takes a minute to contribute to the database by [creating](https://musicbrainz.org/artist/create) a new entity.

* _release_: use "single track", not italicised, when the track is published online on its own (e.g. this is the case for many tracks downloaded from Soundcloud).
* _artist name_: includes the featured artist(s) too.
* _label_: use "self-released" when no label.
* _year_: the year the release was released. Can also include the original release date for re-releases.
* _country_: the country the artist(s) is (are) from. For several countries for the same artist, use "&"; to separate between artists. use "/".
* a purchase or download link can be included at the end of the line after a "–".

The capitalisation and other details should follow the MusicBrainz [styleguide](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Style) as closely as possible.
