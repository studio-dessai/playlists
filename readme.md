This is for storing playlists, which are then copied to the corresponding post in the website repo when they are finalised (after the show).

Mix playlists are to be numbered and timed with the start time of each track, after the show recording has been finalised. This makes it easier for time-coding in MixCloud too (see 2014.08.07.md for an example).

There is a backlog.md file to list the tracks that were not played during a show but are already conveniently formatted (according to styleguide.md), just in case we want to use them in another show and not go through the tedious formatting process.
